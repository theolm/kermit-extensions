# Kermit Extensions

Welcome to **Kermit Extensions**, a collection of utilities aimed at enhancing the debugging experience by leveraging the powerful logging API of [Kermit](https://github.com/touchlab/Kermit). This repository is home to custom extensions designed to make your development process smoother, more efficient, and ultimately more productive.

## About Kermit

Kermit is a Kotlin Multiplatform logging utility that provides a common logging interface for all platforms. While Kermit itself offers extensive capabilities, our extensions are here to fill in specific needs that arise during the development and debugging processes.

## Current Extensions

### TxtLogWriter

`TxtLogWriter`, is a custom `LogWriter` that, when integrated with Kermit, allows you to write logs to a `.txt` file. This is particularly useful for sharing logs with teammates or for detailed analysis during the debugging process. Itâ€™s designed to be easy to set up and integrates seamlessly with your existing Kermit setup.
Currently, `TxtLogWriter` is available for Android, iOS and desktop platforms.
